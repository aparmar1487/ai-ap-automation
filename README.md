ðŸ§  AI-Driven Accounts Payable (AP) Automation using LangFlow, Microsoft Fabric & MCP Orchestration

This project is a hands-on learning and build environment for developing an AI-powered Accounts Payable automation system that combines structured SAP-style data, unstructured invoice documents, and AI reasoning workflows orchestrated through LangFlow and the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

The goal is to simulate a real enterprise finance automation use caseâ€”from invoice ingestion to matching and intelligent query answeringâ€”using open-source and Microsoft ecosystem tools.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Objectives

Build an AI workflow assistant (Ask Agent) that answers questions about AP data (structured + unstructured).

Develop a 3-Way Match Agent that automates invoice extraction, validation, and classification into Full Match, Partial Match, or No Match.

Implement an MCP-based reasoning router that selects the right engine based on query intent:

SQL Engine â†’ numeric summaries and aggregations

Graph Engine â†’ relationship and multi-hop reasoning

RAG Engine â†’ semantic and policy-based explanations

Load and manage SAP-style datasets inside a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold).

Enable model performance evaluation through Eval Tools (e.g., OpenAI Evals, LangSmith, or TruLens).

Manage code and workflow versions via GitHub, promoting MLOps-style collaboration and documentation.
